## Approach

1. Loop through the second position of the array to the length of the array.
2. If the current value from the array is equal to the previous value, remove the item on that position and decress the index count from the loop.

Algorithm

## Complexity

- `Time complexity: O(n)`
- `Space complexity: O(1)`
